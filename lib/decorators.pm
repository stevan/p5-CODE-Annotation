=head1 DESCRIPTION

Decorators are subroutines that are run at compile time to modify the
behavior of a method. This can be something as drastic as replacing
the method body, or something as unintrusive as simply tagging the
method with metadata.

=head2 DECORATORS

A decorator is simply a callback which is associated with a given
subroutine and fired during compile time.

=head2 How are decorators registered?

Decorators are registered via a mapping of decorator providers, which
are just packages containing decorator subroutines, and the class in
which you intend to apply the decorators.

This is done by passing in the provider package name when using
the L<decorators> package, like so:

    package My::Class;
    use decorators 'My::Provider';

This will make available, all the decorators in F<My::Provider>
for use inside F<My::Class>.

=head2 How are decorators associated?

Decorators are associated to a subroutine using the "attribute"
feature of Perl. When the "attribute" mechanism is triggered for
a given method, we extract the name of the attribute and then
attempt to find a decorator of that name in the associated
providers.

This means that in the following code:

    package My::Class;
    use decorators 'My::Provider';

    sub foo : SomeTrait { ... }

We will encounter the C<foo> method and see that it has the
C<SomeTrait> "attribute". We will then look to see if there is a
C<SomeTrait> decorator available in the F<My::Provider> provider, and
if found, will call that decorator.

=head2 How are decorators called?

The decorators are called immediately when the "attribute" mechanism
is triggered. The decorator callbacks receieve at least two arguments,
the first being a L<MOP::Class> instance representing the
subroutine's package, the next being the L<MOP::Method> instance
representing the subroutine itself, and then, if there are any
arguments passed to the decorator, they are also passed along.

=head1 PERL VERSION COMPATIBILITY

For the moment I am going to require 5.14.4 because of the following quote
by Zefram in the L<Sub::WhenBodied> documentation:

  Prior to Perl 5.14.4, attribute handlers are executed before the body
  is attached, so see it in that intermediate state. (From Perl 5.14.4
  onwards, attribute handlers are executed after the body is attached.)
  It is otherwise unusual to see the subroutine in that intermediate
  state.

I am also using the C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE}> variable, which was introduced in
5.14.

It likely is possible using L<Devel::GlobalPhase> and C<Sub::WhenBodied>
to actually implment this all for pre-5.14 perls, but for now I am not
going to worry about that.
